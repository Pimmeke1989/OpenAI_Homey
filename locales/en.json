    "aware2": "Text-to-speech interfaces usually have a maximum limit for text input to be around 200 characters. Anything longer may result in no sound at all.",
    "aware3": "Using partial answers will solve both of these issues for you as they are both responsive and limited in length. If you're using full answers you will have to deal with these issues yourself.",
    "use": "Recommended use",
    "use1": "This example will start processing responses as fast as they arrive by sending them to the Homey text-to-speech interface. Note that when the text-to-speech command has completed talking, a request for the next partial response is sent. Unless this is triggered the entire process will be stalled as the output from ChatGPT will be kept in the output Queue for the app.",
    "use2": "This example will, after the selected trigger event, send a question to ChatGPT. There will be no waiting, but instead, trigger the partial response in the previous example.",

If you input anything within this timeframe then it will be appended to the previous context and as such the responses will be coloured by this. After 10 minutes without any activity, the entire context is forgotten. Note that all contexts are prepended with the prefix in the settings.",
